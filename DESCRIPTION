Description: A quick and easy wrapper for pulling track audio features from 
  Spotify's Web API in bulk. By automatically batching API requests, it allows 
  you to enter an artist's name and retrieve their entire discography in 
  seconds, along with Spotify's audio features and track/album popularity 
  metrics. You can also pull song and playlist information for a given Spotify 
  User (including yourself!).
