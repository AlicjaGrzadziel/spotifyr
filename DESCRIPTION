Description: A fast and scalable wrapper for extracting track audio features 
  from the Spotify Web API. By automatically batching API requests, it allows 
  you to enter an artist's name and retrieve their entire discography in 
  seconds, along with Spotify's audio features and track/album popularity 
  metrics. You can also pull song and playlist information for a given Spotify 
  User (including yourself!).
